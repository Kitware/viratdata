        <p class="animated fadeInUp">The VIRAT Video Dataset is designed to be realistic, 
		natural and challenging for video surveillance domains in terms of its 
		resolution, background clutter, diversity in scenes, and human activity/event 
		categories than existing action recognition datasets. It has become a benchmark 
		dataset for the computer vision community.</p>
		 <p class="animated fadeInUp"><strong>NEWS:<br>
		January 2020: The VIRAT Video dataset annotations that were created as part of the IARPA DIVA program are now available
		in a public repository <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/viratdata/viratannotations" style="color:#95e97a">here</a>. The repository also contains 
		the <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/viratdata/viratannotations/blob/master/DIVA-Annotation-Guidelines-V1.0.docx.pdf" style="color:#95e97a">activity definitions</a> used for the annotations.

            <h2>About the VIRAT Video dataset</h2>
          </div>
          <p>The VIRAT video dataset distinguishes itself on the following characteristics.</p>
		  <p><strong>Realism and natural scenes</strong>: Data was collected in natural scenes 
			showing people performing normal actions in standard contexts, 
			with uncontrolled, cluttered backgrounds. There are frequent incidental
			movers and background activities. Actions performed by directed actors 
			were minimized; most were actions performed by the general population.</p>
			<p><strong>Diversity</strong>: Data was collected at multiple sites distributed throughout 
			the USA. A variety of camera viewpoints and resolutions were included, and 
			actions are performed by many different people.</p>
			<p><strong>Quantity</strong>: Diverse types of human actions and human-vehicle interactions
			are included, with a large number of examples (>30) per action class.</p>
			<p><strong>Wide range of resolution and frame rates</strong>: Many applications such as video 
			surveillance operate across a wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions. 
			The dataset is designed to capture these ranges, with 2–30Hz frame rates and 
			10–200 pixels in person-height. The dataset provides both the original videos 
			with HD quality and downsampled versions both spatially and temporally.</p>
			<p><strong>Ground and Aerial Videos</strong>: Both ground camera videos and aerial videos
			are collected released as part of VIRAT Video Dataset.</p>
		<p>The VIRAT Video Dataset contains two broad categories of activities (single-object and two-objects) 
		which involve both human and vehicles. Details of included activities, and annotation formats 
		may differ per release. Relevant information can be
          found from each release information.</p>

		<h3>Additional Data and Annotations</h3>
			<p>The large-scale <strong>Multiview Extended Video with Activities (MEVA)</strong>
			dataset features more than 250 hours of ground camera video, with additional resources such as UAV video, camera models,
			and a subset of 12.5 hours of annotated data. The dataset is designed for activity detection in multi-camera environments. 
			It was created on the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) 
			Deep Intermodal Video Analytics (DIVA) program to support DIVA performers and the broader research community. The dataset and
			annotations are available at the <a href="http://mevadata.org/">mevadata.org</a> site. </p> 
		<h3>Release News</h3>
          <p><strong>December 29, 2016</strong>: Aerial annotations status: Annotating the aerial 
		  video proved extremely challenging, and we were unable to complete the annotations on the 
		  original contract. We are actively pursuing promising funding opportunities and hope to 
		  have an update soon.</p>
		  <p><strong>2012 Jan 11th</strong>: Version 2.0 of the VIRAT Public Dataset is 
		  updated with Aerial video subsets. Currently, only videos are available. </p>
		  <p><strong>2011 Oct 4th</strong>: Version 2.0 of the VIRAT Public Dataset is
		  released with Ground video subsets. All videos, totalling ~8.5 hours of HD data, are Stationary Ground Videos. 
		  The annotations are for 12 event types, annotated in videos from 11 different outdoor scenes. The release also 
		  includes suggested evaluation metrics and methodologies (data folds for cross-validation etc.)</p>
		  <p>Release 2.0 is described in a PDF available <a href="https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/file/56f581c88d777f753209c9ce/download">here</a>. </p>

		They feature full tracks on all movers in the video data, with activity annotations for 46 activity types and 7 object types. The annotations
		are partitioned into train and validate sets. The <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/viratdata/viratannotations/blob/master/DIVA-Annotation-Guidelines-V1.0.docx.pdf">
		Annotation Guidelines</a> define and detail the object and activity types for these annotations.</p>
